# MAOS
Python Valorant Third-party Launcher

MCOS: Multi-account one setting

## About:
When you have multiple accounts and share them with your friends, your accounts will become chaotic. You won't know which account is currently in use, and when you log in. You may spend a lot of time adjusting your settings. It is really annoying. So, I created this launcher to have full control over these accounts.

## Features:
- Account Switcher
- Centralize a game setting
  - Set your settings when you play
  - Set them back when you quit the game
- Match history (developing)
- Account status 
  - Check if your friend is currently in use
- Quick access:
  - shortcut of each account
